Restaurant scenario based on superspreading event (https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7323555/)

- 28 susceptible agents, 1 infectious
- measure: airflow
- max simulation time: 85 mins, but different overlapping times with table A (see https://doi.org/10.1016/j.buildenv.2021.107788)
- dose-response assumption: high-risk scenario is considered as: A susceptible person is standing less than 1.5m apart from an infectious person for at least 10 mins.
    We measure the number of inhaled pathogens for this high-risk situation and set it as a threshold for an infection.

results:
- without airflow: 12/28 susceptible agents get infected
- with airflow (inlet and outlet on right side, inlet velocity 0.3m/s): 4/28 susceptible agents get infected
- with airflow (inlet on right, outlet on left side, inlet velocity 0.3m/s): 0/28 susceptible agents get infected
