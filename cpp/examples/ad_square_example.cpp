/*  This example computes the derivative of f(x) = x^2 in two different ways:
 *  1. Using the forward mode of algorithmic differentiation (AD)
 *  2. Using the reverse mode of algorithmic differentiation 
 *  
 *  Assume, a subroutine is given that computes y = f(x), where x is an n-dimenstional input vector
 *  and y is an m-dimensional output vector. 
 *  
 *  Forward mode AD (also known as tangent-linear mode)
 *  computes Jacobian-vector products of f(x). I.e., if J(x) denotes the Jacobian of f(x) and
 *  v is an n-dimensional seed vector, the forward mode computes the matrix-vector product
 *  J(x) * v. To this end, The data type of x is set to a forward mode AD data type that additionally to the
 *  original value, also stores derivative information. The original value is accessed by the command
 *  ad::value(x). The derivative information is accessed by ad::derivative(x) which is accordingly
 *  used to set the seed vector v, i.e., ad::derivative(x) = v.
 *  After the conmputation the Jacobian-vector product is accessed by the command ad::derivative(y).
 *  
 *  Reverse mode (also known as adjoint mode, or back progpagation) computes vector-Jacobian products of f(x).
 *  I.e, if J(x) denotes the Jacobian of f(x) and
 *  w is an m-dimensional seed vector (which is a row vector), the reverse mode computes the vector-matrix product
 *  w * J(x). The data type of x is set to a reverse mode AD data type that additionally to the
 *  original value, also stores derivative information. The original value is accessed by the command
 *  ad::value(x). The derivative information is accessed by ad::derivative(x).
 *  While the forward mode computes derivatives in one sweep, the reverse mode computes is divided
 *  into two sweeps. A forward sweep for the computation, where intermediate results are stored on a temporary
 *  memory location called tape. After
 *  the forward sweep, the seed of the computation is set by the command ad::derivative(y) = w.
 *  And a reverse sweep, where the actual derivative computation takes place, has to be performed. The derivative information of
 *  x has to be initalized to zero (ad::derivative(x) = 0), before the tape can be interpreted backwards. Then, 
 *  the tape can interpreted backwards
 *  and the vector-Jacobian product can be accessed the command ad::derivative(x).
 *  
 *  For a concise introduction to AD we recommend the article: 
 *  Verma, Arun. "An introduction to automatic differentiation." Current Science (2000): 804-807.
