# ODE SEIRDB compartment model

This directory contains a SEIRDB (Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered-Dead-Buried) model implementation based on an ODE formulation.
It extends the SEIR model by introducing explicit Dead and Buried compartments with configurable recovery probability, burial delay, and infectiousness of the dead.
