# ODE SEIRDB compartment model

This directory contains a SEIRDB (Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered-Dead-Buried) model implementation based on an ODE formulation.
It extends the SEIR model by introducing explicit Dead and Buried compartments with configurable recovery probability, burial delay, and infectiousness of the dead.

To get started, check out the [official documentation](https://memilio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cpp/models/oseirdb.html) 
or the [code example](../../examples/ode_seirdb.cpp).
