/**
 * @brief Select a random transition from a list of possible transitions from the current state to others.
 * Each transition is represented by the new state and the probability of the transition, e.g. 
 * a pair {1, 0.5} is the transition to state 1 with rate 0.5.
 * Transition rates are not probabilities but the parameters of an exponential distribution.
 * One of the transitions happens if x < dt, where x is a sample from the exponential distribution Exp(S), 
 * S begin the sum of all rates. Which transition happens is determined by sampling from a discrete distribution
 * with the rates as weights. It's also possible that no transition happens in this time step.
 * In this case the current state is returned.
 * @tparam RNG Type that satisfies the UniformRandomBitGenerator concept.
 * @tparam T Type that represents the states.
 * @tparam NumTransitions Number of possible transitions.
 * @param[inout] rng RandomNumberGenerator.
 * @param[in] current_state Current state before transition.
 * @param[in] dt Length of the time step.
 * @param[in] transitions Array of pairs of new states and their rates (probabilities).
 * @return New state from the list if transition happens, current_state otherwise.
