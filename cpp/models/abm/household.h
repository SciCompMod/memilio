 * A HouseholdMember has a vector with weighted age distribution from which the age can be calculated.

 * E.g. if 10 households hold a member of "child and parent" and that Household would be parentAndChildHousehold the
 * vector would contain <parentAndChildHousehold, 10>. parentAndChildHousehold would consist of a vector with the
 * HouseholdMembers parent and child and parent has, for example the age distribution {0,0,10,1,0,0} with respect to the 
 * AgeGroup class. The child would have, for example, {1,1,0,0,0}, meaning that the AgeGroups 0-4 and 5-14 are the only
