# SECIRTS-type model including multi-layer waning immunity

This model extends the SECIRVVS model by adding waning immunity and introducing temporary immunity states that change the meaning of recovery.
We structured the model into three layers of immunity: naive immunity, partial immunity, improved immunity.

In the model, waning immunity is defined by the parameters `TimeWaningPartialImmunity`, `TimeWaningImprovedImmunity`, `TimeTemporaryImmunityPI`, and `TimeTemporaryImmunityII`. The parameters `TimeWaningPartialImmunity` and `TimeWaningImprovedImmunity` represent the (mean) duration after which an individual transitions  from one immunity layer to the next less protected one due to waning immunity, assuming no vaccination or recovery from infection has occurred during this period. Also, the parameters `TimeTemporaryImmunityPI` and `TimeTemporaryImmunityII` denote the (mean) duration of temporary immunity following exposure to the virus, either through vaccination or recovery. During this state of temporary immunity, individuals are protected from reinfection and are incapable of transmitting the virus to others. Should individuals previously reside in the naive or partial immunity layer, their stay in the temporary immunity state results in a transition to the next more protected immunity layer.

Below is an overview of the model architecture and its compartments.
