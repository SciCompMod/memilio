# MEmilio Models #

Contains different concrete models that are built using the MEmilio C++ library. Some models contain a spatial resolution and some do not contain spatial resolution, hence cannot capture spatially heterogenous dynamics.
The models with spatial resolution are:
  - abm
  - d_abm

The models without spatial resolution are:
  - ode_*
  - ide_*
  - lct_*
  - glct_*
  - sde_*
  
See the corresponding directory for details about each model.
