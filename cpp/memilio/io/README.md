# MEmilio C++ IO

This directory contains utilities for reading and writing data from and to files in different formats. 

The main part is a serialization framework that can be used to define the structure of data without using a specific file format. There are implementations of the framework for different formats. The framework is described in detail [in the documentation](https://memilio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cpp/io.html#the-serialization-framework), also see the [serialization example](../../examples/serialize.cpp).

The [comand line interface](https://memilio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cpp/io.html#the-command-line-interface) and the [History object](https://memilio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cpp/io.html#working-with-the-history-object) are also explained in the [documentation](https://memilio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cpp/io.html).
