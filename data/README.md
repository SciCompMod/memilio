# MEmilio Data #

This directory contains a minimal set of data used for real-world epidemiological simulations. To separate model code from data, data has been removed on purpose. Additional datasets (e.g., daily reported COVID‑19 data or mobility matrices for Germany) can be added using the MEmilio Epidata Package [MEmilio Python library](../pycode/memilio-epidata/README.rst).
