Model usage
===========

This section describes how to use the models implemented in MEmilio. It provides an overview of the model structure, the models' components, and how to run simulations with existing models. Furthermore, an additional section explains more broadly for many models how to in- and output data to and from the models to inspect, study, and validate the particular outcomes.
