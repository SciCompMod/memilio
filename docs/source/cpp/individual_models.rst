Individual-based models
=======================

There are two individual- or agent-based models (ABMs) implemented in MEmilio. 
The diffusive ABM realizes agent movement through a diffusion process with disease transmission and progression modeled by stochastic jump processes.
The mobility-based ABM is much more advanced and realizes agent movement between discrete locations by either mobility rules or so-called trips.
Additionally, agents have much more features e.g. an individual infection history as well as features related to quarantine or immunization.
