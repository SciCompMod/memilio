2 Diseases in LCT-based SECIR-type model
==========================

| The LCT-SECIR-2-DISEASES model is an extension of the :doc:`model with one disease <lsecir>`.
| The model is ODE-based and uses the Linear Chain Trick to allow for more general Erlang distributed stay times in each compartment instead of just exponentially distributed stay times induced by basic ODE-based models.
| With the SECIR structure the model is particularly suited for pathogens with pre- or asymptomatic infection states and when severe or critical states are possible. 
| For the two diseases or variants of one disease :math:`a` and :math:`b` the model assumes no co-infection, a certain independence in the sense that prior infection with one disease does not affect the infection with the other disease (e.g. probability to get infected, time spend in each state, chances of recovery etc.), and perfect immunity after recovery for both diseases.


There are two possibilities for a susceptible individual (since we assume no co-infection): 
 1. Get infected with disease a, then (if not dead) get infected with disease b
 2. Get infected with disease b, then (if not dead) get infected with disease a

Each infection is simulated using a LCT-SECIR model. The states are labeled according to infection (first or second) and disease (:math:`a` or :math:`b`),
so the full model is given by the combination of infections :math:`1a`, :math:`2a`, :math:`1b`, and :math:`2b`.

Below is a visualization of the infection states split into LCT-states and transitions without a stratification according to sociodemographic groups.

The compartments :math:`C, I` are infectious (red), the other compartments are considered to be not infectious (blue), 
due to extensive isolation of the hospitalized individuals.


Infection States
----------------

The model contains the following list of **InfectionState**\s:

.. code-block:: RST

    `Susceptible`

    `Exposed_1a`
    `InfectedNoSymptoms_1a`
    `InfectedSymptoms_1a`
    `InfectedSevere_1a`
    `InfectedCritical_1a`

    `Recovered_a`
    `Dead_a`

    `Exposed_2a`
    `InfectedNoSymptoms_2a`
    `InfectedSymptoms_2a`
    `InfectedSevere_2a`
    `InfectedCritical_2a`

    `Exposed_1b`
    `InfectedNoSymptoms_1b`
    `InfectedSymptoms_1b`
    `InfectedSevere_1b`
    `InfectedCritical_1b` 
    
    `Recovered_b`
    `Dead_b`

    `Exposed_2b`
    `InfectedNoSymptoms_2b`
    `InfectedSymptoms_2b`
    `InfectedSevere_2b`
    `InfectedCritical_2b`
   
    `Recovered_ab`

| It is possible to include subcompartments for the states `E`, `C`, `I`, `H`, and `U`, so compartments 
| Exposed_1a, Exposed_2a, Exposed_1b, Exposed_2b,
| InfectedNoSymptoms_1a, InfectedNoSymptoms_2a, InfectedNoSymptoms_1b, InfectedNoSymptoms_2b,
| InfectedSymptoms_1a , InfectedSymptoms_2a, InfectedSymptoms_1b , InfectedSymptoms_2b, 
| InfectedSevere_1a, InfectedSevere_2a , InfectedSevere_1b , InfectedSevere_2b,
| InfectedCritical_1a, InfectedCritical_2a, InfectedCritical_1b, and InfectedCritical_2b. 
 
The number of subcompartments can be set individually for each compartment.


Sociodemographic Stratification
-------------------------------

In the LCT-SECIR-2D model, the population can be stratified by one sociodemographic dimension. 
This dimension is denoted **Group**. It can be used for age groups as well as for other interpretations. 
Different age groups can have different numbers of subcompartments.

Initial conditions
------------------

To initialize the model, we start by defining the number of subcompartments for every compartment and constructing the model with it.

.. code-block:: cpp
    
    constexpr size_t NumExposed_1a = 1, NumInfectedNoSymptoms_1a = 1, NumInfectedSymptoms_1a = 1,
                     NumInfectedSevere_1a = 1, NumInfectedCritical_1a = 1, NumExposed_2a = 1,
                     NumInfectedNoSymptoms_2a = 1, NumInfectedSymptoms_2a = 1, NumInfectedSevere_2a = 1,
                     NumInfectedCritical_2a = 1, NumExposed_1b = 1, NumInfectedNoSymptoms_1b = 1,
                     NumInfectedSymptoms_1b = 1, NumInfectedSevere_1b = 1, NumInfectedCritical_1b = 1,
                     NumExposed_2b = 1, NumInfectedNoSymptoms_2b = 1, NumInfectedSymptoms_2b = 1,
                     NumInfectedSevere_2b = 1, NumInfectedCritical_2b = 1;
    using InfState = mio::lsecir2d::InfectionState;
    using LctState = mio::LctInfectionState<
        InfState, 1, NumExposed_1a, NumInfectedNoSymptoms_1a, NumInfectedSymptoms_1a, NumInfectedSevere_1a,
        NumInfectedCritical_1a, 1, 1, NumExposed_2a, NumInfectedNoSymptoms_2a, NumInfectedSymptoms_2a,
        NumInfectedSevere_2a, NumInfectedCritical_2a, NumExposed_1b, NumInfectedNoSymptoms_1b, NumInfectedSymptoms_1b,
        NumInfectedSevere_1b, NumInfectedCritical_1b, 1, 1, NumExposed_2b, NumInfectedNoSymptoms_2b,
        NumInfectedSymptoms_2b, NumInfectedSevere_2b, NumInfectedCritical_2b, 1>;
    using Model = mio::lsecir2d::Model<LctState>;
    Model model;

For the simulation, we need initial values for all (sub)compartments. If we do not set the initial values manually, these are set to :math:`0` by default.

We start with constructing a vector ``initial_populations`` that we will pass on to the model. It contains vectors for each compartment, 
that contains a vector with initial values for the respective subcompartments. 

.. code-block:: cpp
    
    std::vector<std::vector<ScalarType>> initial_populations = {  
        {200},  {0, 0},  {30, 10, 0}, {0, 0, 0}, {0, 0, 0}, {0, 0},     {0},       {0},       {0},
        {0, 0}, {10, 0}, {0, 0},      {0},       {10, 0},   {30, 0, 0}, {0, 0, 0}, {0, 0, 0}, {0, 0},
        {0},    {0},     {100},       {0, 0},    {0, 0},    {0, 0},     {0},       {0}};

    
We assert that the vector has the correct size by checking that the number of `InfectionState`\s and the numbers of subcompartments are correct.

.. code-block:: cpp

    if (initial_populations.size() != (size_t)InfState::Count) {
        mio::log_error("The number of vectors in initial_populations does not match the number of InfectionStates.");
        return 1;
    }
    if ((initial_populations[(size_t)InfState::Susceptible].size() !=
         LctState::get_num_subcompartments<InfState::Susceptible>()) ||
        (initial_populations[(size_t)InfState::Exposed_1a].size() != NumExposed_1a) ||
        (initial_populations[(size_t)InfState::InfectedNoSymptoms_1a].size() != NumInfectedNoSymptoms_1a) ||
        (initial_populations[(size_t)InfState::InfectedSymptoms_1a].size() != NumInfectedSymptoms_1a) ||
        (initial_populations[(size_t)InfState::InfectedSevere_1a].size() != NumInfectedSevere_1a) ||
        (initial_populations[(size_t)InfState::InfectedCritical_1a].size() != NumInfectedCritical_1a) ||
        (initial_populations[(size_t)InfState::Exposed_2a].size() != NumExposed_2a) ||
        (initial_populations[(size_t)InfState::InfectedNoSymptoms_2a].size() != NumInfectedNoSymptoms_2a) ||
        (initial_populations[(size_t)InfState::InfectedSymptoms_2a].size() != NumInfectedSymptoms_2a) ||
        (initial_populations[(size_t)InfState::InfectedSevere_2a].size() != NumInfectedSevere_2a) ||
        (initial_populations[(size_t)InfState::InfectedCritical_2a].size() != NumInfectedCritical_2a) ||
        (initial_populations[(size_t)InfState::Recovered_a].size() !=
         LctState::get_num_subcompartments<InfState::Recovered_a>()) ||
        (initial_populations[(size_t)InfState::Dead_a].size() !=
         LctState::get_num_subcompartments<InfState::Dead_a>()) ||
        (initial_populations[(size_t)InfState::Exposed_1b].size() != NumExposed_1b) ||
        (initial_populations[(size_t)InfState::InfectedNoSymptoms_1b].size() != NumInfectedNoSymptoms_1b) ||
        (initial_populations[(size_t)InfState::InfectedSymptoms_1b].size() != NumInfectedSymptoms_1b) ||
        (initial_populations[(size_t)InfState::InfectedSevere_1b].size() != NumInfectedSevere_1b) ||
        (initial_populations[(size_t)InfState::InfectedCritical_1b].size() != NumInfectedCritical_1b) ||
        (initial_populations[(size_t)InfState::Exposed_2b].size() != NumExposed_2b) ||
        (initial_populations[(size_t)InfState::InfectedNoSymptoms_2b].size() != NumInfectedNoSymptoms_2b) ||
        (initial_populations[(size_t)InfState::InfectedSymptoms_2b].size() != NumInfectedSymptoms_2b) ||
        (initial_populations[(size_t)InfState::InfectedSevere_2b].size() != NumInfectedSevere_2b) ||
        (initial_populations[(size_t)InfState::InfectedCritical_2b].size() != NumInfectedCritical_2b) ||
        (initial_populations[(size_t)InfState::Recovered_ab].size() !=
         LctState::get_num_subcompartments<InfState::Recovered_ab>())) {
            mio::log_error("The length of at least one vector in initial_populations does not match the related number of "
                          "subcompartments.");
            return 1;
        }

The initial populations in the model are set via:

.. code-block:: cpp

    std::vector<ScalarType> flat_initial_populations;
    for (auto&& vec : initial_populations) {
        flat_initial_populations.insert(flat_initial_populations.end(), vec.begin(), vec.end());
    }
    for (size_t i = 0; i < LctState::Count; i++) {
        model.populations[i] = flat_initial_populations[i];
    }

.. _Nonpharmaceutical Interventions:
Nonpharmaceutical Interventions
-------------------------------

In the LCT-SECIR-2D model, nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) are implemented through dampings in the contact matrix. 
These dampings reduce the contact rates between different groups to simulate interventions.

Basic dampings can be added to the contact matrix as follows:

.. code-block:: cpp

    // Create a contact matrix with constant contact rate 10 (one age group).
    mio::ContactMatrixGroup& contact_matrix = model.parameters.get<mio::lsecir2d::ContactPatterns>();
    contact_matrix[0]                       = mio::ContactMatrix(Eigen::MatrixXd::Constant(1, 1, 10));

    // From SimulationTime 5, the contact pattern is reduced to 30% of the initial value.
    contact_matrix[0].add_damping(0.7, mio::SimulationTime(5.));

For age-resolved models, you can apply different dampings to different groups:

.. code-block:: cpp

    // Create a contact matrix with constant contact rate 10 between all age groups
    contact_matrix[0] = mio::ContactMatrix(Eigen::MatrixXd::Constant(num_agegroups, num_agegroups, 10));
    
    // Add a damping that reduces contacts within the same age group by 70% starting at day 5.
    contact_matrix.add_damping(Eigen::VectorX<ScalarType>::Constant(num_agegroups, 0.7).asDiagonal(),
                             mio::SimulationTime(5.));

Simulation
----------

We can simulate the model from :math:`t_0` to :math:`t_{\max}` with initial step size :math:`dt` as follows:

.. code-block:: cpp

    ScalarType t0 = 0;
    ScalarType tmax = 10;
    ScalarType dt = 0.5;
    mio::TimeSeries<ScalarType> result = mio::simulate<ScalarType, Model>(t0, tmax, dt, model);


Output
------

The simulation result is stratefied by subcompartments. The function ``calculate_compartments()`` aggregates the subcompartments by `InfectionState`\s.

.. code-block:: cpp

    mio::TimeSeries<ScalarType> population_no_subcompartments = model.calculate_compartments(result);

You can access the data in the `mio::TimeSeries` object as follows:

.. code-block:: cpp

    // Get the number of time points.
    auto num_points = static_cast<size_t>(result.get_num_time_points());
    
    // Access data at a specific time point.
    Eigen::VectorX value_at_time_i = result.get_value(i);
    ScalarType time_i = result.get_time(i);
    
    // Access the last time point.
    Eigen::VectorX last_value = result.get_last_value();
    ScalarType last_time = result.get_last_time();


You can print the simulation results as a formatted table:

.. code-block:: cpp

    // Print results to console with default formatting.
    result.print_table();
    
    // Print with custom column labels and width, and custom number of decimals.
    results.print_table({"   S",   "   E1a", "   C1a", "   I1a", "   H1a", "   U1a", "   Ra",
                                      "   Da",  "   E2a", "   C2a", "   I2a", "   H2a", "   U2a", "   E1b",
                                      "   C1b", "   I1b", "   H1b", "   U1b", "   Rb",  "   Db",  "   E2b",
                                      "   C2b", "   I2b", "   H2b", "   U2b", "   Rab"},
                                     6, 2);

Additionally, you can export the results to a CSV file:

.. code-block:: cpp

    // Export results to CSV with default settings.
    result.export_csv("simulation_results.csv");


Visualization
-------------

To visualize the results of a simulation, you can use the Python package :doc:`m-plot <../../python/m-plot>` and its documentation.
