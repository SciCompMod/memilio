Hybrid models
==============

Hybrid models combine two modeling approaches to balance the trade-off that arises when choosing an appropriate model for a given application. The motivation behind combining two modeling approaches is that multiple models have different advantages and disadvantages, making it difficult to identify a single best option. In MEmilio a temporal hybridization is implemented where the concept is to switch between two models according to a predefined condition during the course of the simulation.
