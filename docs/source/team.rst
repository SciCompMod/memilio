**Research Focus:** High-Performance Computing, Mathematical Modeling, Scientific Computing, Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs)

Henrik Zunker is a PhD student at the Institute for Software Technology at the German Aerospace Center (DLR) since 2022. He is working on the development of MEmilio, focusing on equation-based models. In addition, he is involved in the development of machine learning models acting as surrogate models using various techniques (such as graph neural networks).
