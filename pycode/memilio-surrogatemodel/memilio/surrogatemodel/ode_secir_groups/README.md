# SECIR model with multiple age groups and multiple dampings

This model is an application of the SECIR model implemented in https://github.com/DLR-SC/memilio/tree/main/cpp/models/ode_secir/ stratified by age groups using dampings to represent  changes in the contact matrix.
The example is based on https://github.com/DLR-SC/memilio/tree/main/pycode/examples/simulation/ode_secir_groups.py which uses python bindings to run the underlying C++ code.
