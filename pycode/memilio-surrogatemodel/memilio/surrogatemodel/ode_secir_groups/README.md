# SECIR model with multiple age groups and one damping

This model is an application of the SECIR model implemented in https://github.com/DLR-SC/memilio/tree/main/cpp/models/ode_secir/ stratified by age groups using one damping to represent a change in the contact matrice.
The example is based on https://github.com/DLR-SC/memilio/tree/main/pycode/examples/simulation/secir_groups.py which uses python bindings to run the underlying C++ code.
